# 5x5 gridworld 
# cell at 1-2 is called A and leads agent to A'(5-2) giving reward +10
# cell at 1-4 is called B and leads agent to B'(3-4) giving reward +5 
# The agent can take actions up, down, left, and right.
# Actions that would take agent off the grid, willl leave the agents pos unchanged but inflict reward of -1
# Other actions result in reward of zero
# will probably need transition matrices and states represented by trnsition matrices
